ChromeRecovery

This app pulls your tabs, bookmarks, and browsing history out of a
Chrome profile folder and saves them as HTML files on your Desktop.


HOW TO USE

1. Unzip ChromeRecovery.zip if you haven't already.

2. Double-click ChromeRecovery.app to open it.

3. It will ask you to pick a folder. Pick the Chrome profile folder --
   this is usually called "Default" or "Profile 1" and contains files
   named "Bookmarks", "History", etc.

4. When it's done, you'll find two files on your Desktop:

   Chrome Recovery.html -- open this in any browser to see your
   recovered tabs, bookmarks, and history as clickable links.

   Chrome Bookmarks.html -- use this to import your bookmarks into
   another browser. In most browsers: File > Import Bookmarks, then
   pick this file.


FIRST LAUNCH

macOS will probably block the app the first time because it isn't
signed by a developer account. To get around this:

  Right-click the app > click Open > click Open again in the dialog.

You only have to do this once. After that it opens normally.
